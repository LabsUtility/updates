# About the bot
Thanks for checking out **LabsUtilty**! Below is information and common questions about the bot!
<br/>
<br/>
### What Is LabsUtility?
LabsUtility is a muli-use / purpose bot made for Discord! The bot contains commands for developers, server staff, and regular community members! The bot can be added in two ways:
- `Added as a bot to a server`
- `Added as a authorized app to a user` <br/>
↳ (which allows for the user of many commands anywhere on Discord regardless if the server has the bot!)<br/>

**The availible commands and uses can be found on the official repository**
<br/>
<br/>

### Common Questions
**1. What information is stored on the bot?**
- No information is currently stored on the bot as the bot does not require it and information given when adding the bot to your authorized app is handled by Discord and not us! If, in the future, it is deemed neccessary to store some type of information, a announcement will be made on our Official Discord server and this page will be updated!
<br/>

**2. Are commands hidden to just me?**
- Community commands are not hidden and can be seen by everyone but commands such as the bot's commands for developers are hidden to just the user who triggered it ensuring that information that could be regarded private stays hidden. The content is also not logged by us ensuring full privacy! For more information or questions regarding this matter, you can join our Discord server to ask us directly!
<br/>

**3. Will the bot stay online all the time?**
- LabsUtility offers a constant 24/7 uptime excluding downtimes and restart dates which will be listed on the Discord server! Though accidents and un-anticipated downtimes may occur, we do our best to put the bot back online as soon as possible!
